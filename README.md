# latex-replacements
Sets up abbreviations for common symbols used in math.
The symbols available can be accessed using their LaTeX commands.

Only works on Windows.

### Adding your own shortcuts:
1. [Install AutoHotKey.](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Edit the latex replacements.ahk file in any text editor.
3. Add your shortcuts in the format: `::<text to replace>::<text it is replaced with>` to the end of the file.
4. Save your script.
5. (Optional) Right-click on your saved script and compile it to generate an exe for it.

There are certain hotstrings that are replaced automatically. In order to prevent any issues that arise due to this, the script can now be toggled on and off by the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+S.
